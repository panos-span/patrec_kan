## Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks in Modern Neural Network Design: Reproduction, Innovation, and Real-World Applications

In this paper, we explore the potential of Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs)
through a series of experiments and architectural innovations. 

1. We start by replicating key results on both simple toy functions and more challenging
multivariate special functions, showing that KANs can achieve lower
approximation errors with fewer parameters than traditional MLPs. 

2. Next, we examine the transfer learning capabilities of KAN-based models by finetuning
them on widely used image benchmarks, which confirms their effectiveness in
adapting to new tasks.

3. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel
Kanvolutional layer that combines convolutional operations with adaptive,
learnable nonlinear functions, thereby enhancing model expressiveness while
reducing computational overhead.

4. Finally, we extend our work to the medical
domain by developing a U-KAN model for image segmentation, demonstrating
improved performance and interpretability in real-world applications.

### Overall, our study highlights how adaptive activation functions can lead to lightweight, versatile, and highly effective neural network architectures.
